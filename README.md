Genetic diversity of a highly imperiled, habitat specialist, Etheostoma marmorpinnum, from Little River, TN

Jacob F. Brumley and Rebecca E. Blanton

The federally endangered Marbled Darter, Etheostoma marmorpinnum, is endemic to the Little River in eastern Tennessee. Anthropogenic land use in the upper Tennessee Valley has contributed to degradation and fragmentation of E. marmorpinnum habitat. These changes have resulted in a decrease in population abundance and occurrence of the species, reducing its range from one that historically included the South Fork Holston River to a 20 rkm stretch of the lower Little River. E. marmorpinnum is patchily distributed across this reach of the Little River, utilizing a specific habitat of low-flowing pools with clean gravel and cobble substrate, bracketed by Fort Loudon Dam downstream and Perryâ€™s Mill Dam upstream. Our objectives were to estimate genetic diversity at site and species levels to provide a baseline for conservation actions and for future genetic monitoring. Fifty-six individuals were captured and clipped while snorkeling at 3 known localities that spanned the range of the species. Twenty variable microsatellite loci were used to collect genotypic data for all individuals, and a standard suit of population genetic analyses were performed.
